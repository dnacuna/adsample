========

This package implements the adaptive rejection sampling described by Gilks & Wild (1992). It is implemented in C++ and provides a convenient symbolic differentiation tool and diagnostic graphs.

The algorithm can sample from any univariate log concave densities. This is a large number of densities (especially if you allow minor reparameterizations) but is not all of them. See the paper!
