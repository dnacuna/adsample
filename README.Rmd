This package implements the adaptive rejection sampling described by Gilks 
& Wild (1992). It is implemented in C++ and provides a convenient symbolic
differentiation tool and diagnostic graphs.

The algorithm can sample from any univariate log concave densities. This is a 
large number of densities (especially if you allow minor reparameterizations)
but is not all of them. See the paper!
